## My process

The first thing I did was take a look to the designs images, and see what I needed to do. Then I started to create the HTML code. Once I finished with all the HTML. I started to create the custom properties, such as the different colors, font types and some reusable classes. When I got everything ready I started with all the CSS code, first I finished with the design for mobile devices, then the desktop design and finally I wrote the JavaScript code for the mobile menu.
I had no problem with this challenge, but was really fun to do and I learned a lot

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge helped me to practice javascript and to have more confidence to create the most similar designs possible


### Continued development
I will keep taking more challenges from the page to create more and better designs

### Useful resources

- [How to use filter properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) - This helped me to be able to change the color of the social media icons, the property that I uses was brightness.
